diskusjonsforum_demo is a modified version of the diskusjonsforum project developed for the live demo available on stilian.dev. 

*This version uses a session cookie instead of ASP Identity for user management. It also does not display content generated by users unless they have the same cookie. However, there is no access control and the webapp is vulnerable to HTTP Parameter Pollution attacks. This is not a concern as this version is only used for demo purposes.
*This version has a simplified version of the database and class models as compared to the original project.
